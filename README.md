Here's a step-by-step code example in Julia:

### Step 1: Install Required Packages
If you haven't installed `Flux.jl` and `DifferentialEquations.jl`, you can do so using Julia's package manager:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(["Flux", "DifferentialEquations", "Zygote"])
```

### Step 2: Define the Neural Network
We'll define a simple neural network to which we will apply PDE-based regularization.

```julia
using Flux
using Zygote

# Define a simple feedforward neural network
model = Chain(
    Dense(1, 64, relu), 
    Dense(64, 64, relu), 
    Dense(64, 1)
)
```

### Step 3: Define the Laplacian Regularization Function
We'll define a regularization function based on the Laplacian, which corresponds to the PDE:

\[
\Delta u = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
\]

This function penalizes high curvature in the network's output, enforcing smoothness.

```julia
# Define Laplacian regularization term
function laplacian_regularization(model, x)
    y = model(x)
    dy_dx = gradient(sum(y), x)[1]
    d2y_dx2 = gradient(sum(dy_dx), x)[1]
    laplacian = sum(abs2.(d2y_dx2))  # sum of squared second derivatives
    return laplacian
end
```

### Step 4: Define the Loss Function with Regularization
We'll incorporate the Laplacian regularization into the loss function.

```julia
# Define the main loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error)
function loss_with_regularization(model, x, y_true, λ)
    y_pred = model(x)
    mse_loss = Flux.Losses.mse(y_pred, y_true)
    reg_loss = λ * laplacian_regularization(model, x)
    return mse_loss + reg_loss
end
```

### Step 5: Training Loop
Now, we set up the training loop to optimize the network.

```julia
# Example data (simple 1D regression problem)
x_train = rand(Float32, 100, 1)
y_train = sin.(2π * x_train) + 0.1f0 * randn(Float32, 100, 1)

# Training parameters
epochs = 1000
learning_rate = 0.01
λ = 0.1  # Regularization strength

# Optimizer
opt = Flux.ADAM(learning_rate)

# Training loop
for epoch in 1:epochs
    Flux.train!(params(model)) do
        loss = loss_with_regularization(model, x_train, y_train, λ)
        return loss
    end
    if epoch % 100 == 0
        println("Epoch $epoch, Loss: $(loss_with_regularization(model, x_train, y_train, λ))")
    end
end
```

### Step 6: Evaluate the Model
After training, you can evaluate the model's performance on test data.

```julia
x_test = rand(Float32, 100, 1)
y_test = sin.(2π * x_test)

y_pred = model(x_test)

using Plots
plot(x_test, y_test, label="True")
scatter!(x_test, y_pred, label="Predicted")
```
